To create debian source package you need some other projects sources that
jitsi-videobridge depends on. In the same folder where jitsi-videobridge is
checked out do:
git clone https://github.com/jitsi/libsrc.git
And then in jitsi-videobridge do: ant deb-src
This will create orig.tar.gz debian sources that can be used to debuild
debian package.
